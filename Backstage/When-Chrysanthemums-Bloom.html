<h1 style="text-align: center;">When Chrysanthemums Bloom</h1>

<p>In late spring, when chrysanthemums bloom, grief hits.</p>

<p>I barely knew him. Thoughts and memories scatter, forgotten, like dandelion seeds dancing along a windy breeze.</p>

<p>I chase those dandelion seeds.</p>

<p>The regrets cloud the mind. Though the days and months pass, these emotions stand still.</p>

<p>Pictures I do not have, your voice I remember not, I wonder where I find you?</p>

<p>August changed. Years have passed, and more will do so.</p>

<p>Time never heals all.</p>

<p>Even when chrysanthemums have withered, still, it stays.</p>

<p>In late spring, when chrysanthemums bloom again, grief remains.</p>
