<div class="work">
  <p>In late spring, when chrysanthemums bloom, grief hits.</p>
  <p>I barely knew him. Thoughts and memories scatter, forgotten, like dandelion seeds dancing along a windy breeze.</p>
  <p>I chase those dandelion seeds.</p>
  <p>The regrets cloud the mind. Though the days and months pass, these emotions stand still.</p>
  <p>Pictures I do not have, your voice I remember not, I wonder where I find you?</p>
  <p>August changed. Years have passed, and more will do so.</p>
  <p>Time never heals all.</p>
  <p>Even when chrysanthemums have withered, still, it stays.</p>
  <p>In late spring, when chrysanthemums bloom again, grief remains.</p>
