<p><b>Stoichiometry</b> comes from two Greek words: <i>stoicheion</i> (element) and <i>metron</i> (measure). As Jeremias Richter wrote in 1792, "Stoichiometry is the science of measuring the quantitative proportions or mass ratios in which chemical elements stand to one another."</p>

<h2>The Mole and Molar Mass</h2>
<p>The <b>mole</b> (symbol <b>mol</b>) is one of the most important units in chemistry. It is a unit of measurement for an amount of substance.</p>

$$1\ \text{mol} = 6.022 \times 10^{23}\ \text{entities} \tag{1}$$

<p>Note that the term <i>entities</i> can be atoms, molecules, ions, formula units, etc.</p>

<p>The number 6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> is called <b>Avogadro's number</b>. It is often denoted as \(N_A\).</p>

<div class="example">
  How many atoms are present in 2.14 moles of Vanadium?

  <div class="solution">
    We can use \(N_A\) to convert moles into atoms.

    $$2.14\ \text{mol V} \left( \frac{6.022 \times 10^{23}\ \text{atoms V}}{1\ \text{mol V}} \right) = 1.29 \times 10^{24}\ \text{atoms V}$$

    Thus, there are <b>1.29 × 10<sup>24</sup> atoms</b> of Vanadium in 2.14 moles of it.

<p>The <b>molar mass</b> of any given substance is the mass of one mole of that substance. It is numerically equal to the atomic mass or atomic weight. For example, hydrogen's atomic weight, and thus its molar mass is 1.01 μ or 1.01 g/mol.</p>

<p>For future usage, all atomic weights of elements are to be rounded to two decimal places.</p>

<div class="example">
  Calculate the molar mass of CH<sub>4</sub>.

  <div class="solution">
    We can solve for the molar mass by adding up each individual molar mass of the elements, in this case, carbon and hydrogen. The subscript 4 indicates that there are 4 hydrogen atoms. This becomes the multiple of its molar mass.

    $$\begin{align}
             &\text{C:}\ 1 \times \pu{12.01 g/mol} = \pu{12.01 g/mol}\\
      +\quad &\text{H:}\ 4 \times \pu{1.01 g/mol} = \pu{4.04 g/mol}\\
        \hline
             &\text{Molar mass} = \pu{16.05 g/mol}
    \end{align}$$

    Thus the molar mass of CH<sub>4</sub> is <b>16.05 g/mol</b>.
  </div>
</div>

<p>Building on the previous two concepts learned, we can now solve for problems asking for grams from moles.</p>

<div class="example">
  What is the mass of 0.25 mol of CH<sub>4</sub>?

  <div class="solution">
    In stoichiometry, <i>dimensional analysis</i> is commonly performed. As such, let us analyze the problem. Given the mole value, the mass (presumably in grams) is asked. Thus, the molar mass can be used.

    $$\pu{0.25 mol \ce{CH4}} \left( \frac{\pu{16.05 g}}{\pu{1 mol}}\ \ce{CH4} \right) = \pu{4.0 g \ce{CH4}}$$

    <i>Recall significant figures.</i> Thus, the mass of 0.25 of CH<sub>4</sub> is <b>4.0 grams</b>.
