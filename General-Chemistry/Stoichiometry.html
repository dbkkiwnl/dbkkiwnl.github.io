<p><b>Stoichiometry</b> comes from two Greek words: <i>stoicheion</i> (element) and <i>metron</i> (measure). As Jeremias Richter wrote in 1792, "Stoichiometry is the science of measuring the quantitative proportions or mass ratios in which chemical elements stand to one another."</p>

<h2>The Mole</h2>
The <b>mole</b> (symbol <b>mol</b>) is one of the most important units in chemistry. It is a unit of measurement for an amount of substance. 

$$1\ \text{mol} = 6.022 \times 10^{23}\ \text{entities} \tag{1}$$

The number 6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> is called <b>Avogadro's number</b>. It is often denoted as \(N_A\).

<div class="example">
  How many atoms are present in 2.14 moles of Vanadium?

  <div class="solution">
    We can use \(N_A\) to convert moles into atoms.

    $$2.14\ \text{mol V} = \frac{6.022 \times 10^{23}\ \text{atoms V}}{1\ \text{mol V}} = 2.1077 \times 10^{23}\ \text{atoms V}$
