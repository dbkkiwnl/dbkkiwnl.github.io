<p>Thermodynamics has countless applications. Some that are within your reach like a laptop or a tablet. These are everyday objects that rely on applied thermodynamics called <b>electrochemistry</b>.</p>

<h2>Reduction-oxidation reaction</h2>
<p><b>Reduction-oxidation reactions</b> (or <b>redox reactions</b>) include the formation of a compound from its elements (and the reverse process), all combustion reactions, the generation of electricity in batteries, the production of cellular energy, and many others.</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="color: blue;"><b>Oxidation</b></span> is the loss of electrons.</li>
  <li><span style="color: red;"><b>Reduction</b></span> is the gain of electrons.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each atom in a molecule (or formula unit) is assigned an <b>oxidation number</b> (<b>ON</b>). An oxidation number has the sign before the number (as in +2), whereas a charge has the sign after the number (as in 2+).</p>

  <b>Rules for Assigning an Oxidation Number</b>

  <ol>
    <li>For an atom in its elemental form (Na, O<sub>2</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>, etc.): ON = 0</li>
    <li>For a monatomic ion: ON = charge</li>
    <li>For Group 1: ON = +1</li>
    <li>For Group 2: ON = +2</li>
    <li>For hydrogen: ON = +1 (with nonmetals); ON = -1 (with metals and boron)</li>
    <li>For fluorine: ON = -1</li>
    <li>For oxygen: ON = -1 (in peroxides); ON = -2 (all other compounds)</li>
    <li>For group 7: ON = -1</li>
  </ol>
