<h1 class="lesson-title">Thermochemistry</h1>

<p><b>Thermochemistry</b> is the study of heat energy that is associated with chemical reactions and phase changes.</p>

<h2>Energy</h2>

<p><b>Energy</b> is defined as the capacity to do work or transfer heat. There are two types. <i>Kinetic energy</i> is the energy an object possesses due to its motion. <i>Potential energy</i> is the energy "at rest"â€”having the potential to become another form of energy.</p>

<p><b>Work</b> is the energy used to cause an object to move against a force, and <b>heat</b> is the energy used to cause the temperature of an object to increase.</p>

<h3>Units of Energy</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A <b>joule</b> is the amount of energy needed to move a 1 kilogram mass a distance of 1 meter.</li>
	$$ \text{1 J} = \frac{\text{1 kg} \cdot m^2}{s^2} \tag{1}$$

	<li>A <b>calorie</b> (different from <i>Calorie</i>, in food), is defined as:</li>
	$$ \text{1 cal} = \text{4.184 J} \tag{2}$$
</ul>

<h3>Systems and Surroundings</h3>
<p>It is important to define a system and its surroundings in any thermodynamic study. A <b>system</b> is what is being focused on, and everything else is the <b>surroundings</b>.</p>

<h3>Energy Transfer</h3>
<p><b>Heat</b> (\(q\)) is the energy transferred as a result of a difference in temperature between a system and its surroundings.</p>

<p><b>Work</b> (\(w\)) is the energy transferred when an object is moved by force.</p>

<div class="example">
  A sample of liquid absorbs 13.5 kJ of heat and does 1.8 kJ of work when it vaporizes. Calculate the change in internal energy in Joules.

  <div class="solution">
    We can simply add the work and heat values, then convert it into Joules. Note that since the work is done <i>by</i> the system, it is negative, thus -1.8 kJ.

    $$\begin{align}
    \Delta E &= q + w \\
             &= \left( 13.5 \text{kJ} - 1.8 \text{kJ} \right) \left( \frac{1000 \text{J}}{1 \text{kJ}} \right) \\
             &= 11 700 \text{J}
    \end{align}$$
  </div>
</div>

<p>The main difficulty in calculating change in internal energy problems is identifying the signs of heat and work.</p>

<div class="definition">
  The <b>first law of thermodynamics</b>, the <b>law of conservation of energy</b> states that: 

  <ul>
    <li>Energy cannot be created or destroyed,</li>
    <li>Energy can transferred between objects, and</li>
    <li>Energy can be transformed from one form into another.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>In short, the total energy of the universe, or any system for that matter, is always constant. As such, there is no such thing as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_motion#Classification">perpetual motion machine of the first kind</a>.</p>

<p>There are two types of processes. An <b>endothermic reaction</b> is where heat from the surroundings is absorbed by the system. A common example is electrolysis.</p>
