<h1>Thermochemistry</h1>

<b>Thermochemistry</b> is the study of heat energy that is associated with chemical reactions and phase changes.

<h2>Energy</h2>
<b>Energy</b> is defined as the capacity to do work or transfer heat. There are two types:
<ul>
	<li>Kinetic energy is the energy an object possesses due to its motion.</li>
	<li>Potential energy is the energy "at rest"â€”having the potential to become another form of energy.</li>
</ul>
