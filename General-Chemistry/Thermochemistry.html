<h1>Thermochemistry</h1>

<p><b>Thermochemistry</b> is the study of heat energy that is associated with chemical reactions and phase changes.</p>

<p><b>Energy</b> is defined as the capacity to do work or transfer heat. There are two types. <i>Kinetic energy</i> is the energy an object possesses due to its motion. <i>Potential energy</i> is the energy "at rest"â€”having the potential to become another form of energy.</p>

<p><b>Work</b> is the energy used to cause an object to move against a force, and <b>heat</b> is the energy used to cause the temperature of an object to increase.</p>

<h3>Units of Energy</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A <b>joule</b> is the amount of energy needed to move a 1 kilogram mass a distance of 1 meter.</li>
	$$ \text{1 J} = \frac{\text{1 kg} \cdot m^2}{s^2} \tag{1}$$

	<li>A <b>calorie</b> (different from <i>Calorie</i>, in food), is defined as:</li>
	$$ \text{1 cal} = \text{4.184 J} \tag{2}$$
</ul>

<h3>Systems and Surroundings</h3>
<p>It is important to define a system and its surroundings in any thermodynamic study. A <b>system</b> is what is being focused on, and everything else is the <b>surroundings</b>.</p>

<h3>Energy Transfer</h3>
<p><b>Heat</b> (\(q\)) is the energy transferred as a result of a difference in temperature between a system and its surroundings.</p>

<p><b>Work</b> (\(w\)) is the energy transferred when an object is moved by force.</p>
