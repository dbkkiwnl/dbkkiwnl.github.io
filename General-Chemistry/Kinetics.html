<p><b>Chemical kinetics</b> studies the rate at which a chemical process occurs.</p>

<h2>Factors Affecting Rate of Reaction</h2>
<p><b>Concentration.</b> A reaction can occur only if the reactant molecules collide. The more molecules present in the container, the more frequently they collide, and so the more often they react.</p>
<p class="center">Rate &prop; collision energy &prop; concentration</p>
<p><b>Surface area.</b> The greater its surface area, the more contact it makes with the other reactant, and the faster the reaction occurs. For example, in burning of a solid fuel like wood, increasing the surface area by chopping wood into smaller pieces makes it combust faster.</p>
<p><b>Temperature.</b></p>
<p><b>Energy of collisions.</b></p>

<h2>Reaction Rate</h2>
<p>The speed of a chemical reaction, or its <b>rate</b>, is defined as:</p>

$$\text{rate} = \frac{\Delta \text{concentration}}{\Delta \text{time}} \tag{1}$$

<p>In general, a reaction in the form \(\ce{aA + bB -> cC + dD}\), the rate can be expressed as:</p>

$$\text{rate} = -\frac{1}{a}\frac{\Delta [A]}{\Delta t} = -\frac{1}{b}\frac{\Delta [B]}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{c}\frac{\Delta [C]}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{d}\frac{\Delta [D]}{\Delta t} \tag{2}$$

<p>As the reactants decrease, the products increase. Observe that the signs for the reactants A and B are negative, while the products C and D are positive.</p>

<div class="example">
  Express the rate in terms of changes for the entire chemical equation.

  $$\ce{H2 (g) + I2 (g) -> 2HI (g)}$$
  <details>
    <summary>Show solution</summary>
    <div class="solution">
      The rate of the equation above is:

      $$\text{rate} = -\frac{\Delta \ce{[H2]}}{\Delta t} = -\frac{\Delta \ce{[I2]}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta \ce{[HI]}}{2 \Delta t}$$
    </div>
  </details>
</div>

<div class="example">
  Hydrogen gas has a nonpolluting combustion product (water vapor). It is used as a fuel aboard the space shuttle and in earthbound cars with prototype engines.

  $$\ce{2H2 (g) + O2 (g) -> 2H2O (g)}$$

  (a) Express the rate in terms of changes in [H<sub>2</sub>], [O<sub>2</sub>], [H<sub>2</sub>O] with time.
  <br>
  (b) When [O<sub>2</sub>] is decreasing at 0.23 mol/L⋅s, at what rate is [H<sub>2</sub>O] increasing?

  <details>
    <summary>Show solution</summary>
    <div class="solution">
      (a) Referring to Equation 2,

      $$\text{rate} = -\frac{\Delta \ce{[H2]}}{2 \Delta t} = -\frac{\Delta \ce{[O2]}}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\Delta \ce{[H2O]}}{\Delta t}$$

      (b) Since the rates of the chemical equation are all equal to each other, the rate of [O<sub>2</sub>] is half of the rate of [H<sub>2</sub>O]. Since [O<sub>2</sub>] is decreasing, it is negative: -0.23 mol/L⋅s.

      $$\begin{align*}
      \frac{1}{2} \frac{\Delta \ce{[H2O]}}{\Delta t} &= -\frac{\Delta \ce{[O2]}}{\Delta t} \\
      \frac{1}{2} \frac{\Delta \ce{[H2O]}}{\Delta t} &= -(\pu{-0.23 mol/L*s}) \\
      \frac{\Delta \ce{[H2O]}}{\Delta t} &= 2(\pu{0.23 mol/L*s}) \\
      \frac{\Delta \ce{[H2O]}}{\Delta t} &= \pu{0.46 mol/L*s} \\
      \end{align*}$$

      Therefore, [H<sub>2</sub>O] is increasing at a rate of <b>0.46 mol/L⋅s</b>.

<h2>The Rate Law and Its Components</h2>
<p>For a reaction occuring at a fixed temperature, \(\ce{aA + bB + \cdots -> cC + dD \cdots}\), its rate law is:</p>

$$\text{rate} = k\ce{[A]}^m\ce{[B]}^n \cdots$$

<p>wherein <i>k</i> is called the <b>rate constant</b>, and <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> are the reaction orders. A reaction has an individual order with respect to each reactant, and and overall reaction order.</p>

<p>Note that the balancing coefficients in the equation (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>) are not necessarily related to <i>m</i> and <i>n</i>. The components of the rate law are only found by experiment.</p>

<p>For example, in a reaction with a single reactant \(\ce{A -> products}\), the following are the possible reaction orders:</p>

<table class="clean-table center">
  <caption><b>Table 1.</b> Rate laws for a single reactant.</caption>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Reaction order</th>
    <th>Rate law</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>zero order</td>
    <td class="a-left">\(\text{rate} = k\ce{[A]}^0 = k\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>first order</td>
    <td class="a-left">\(\text{rate} = k\ce{[A]}^1 = k\ce{[A]}\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>second order</td>
    <td class="a-left">\(\text{rate} = k\ce{[A]}^2\)</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>In summary, the reaction orders are the exponents, and the overall reaction order is determined by adding each individual reaction order.</p>

<div class="example">
  For the following reaction, use the given rate law to determine the reaction order with respect to each reactant and the overall order:

  $$\ce{2NO (g) + O2 (g) -> 2NO2 (g)};\ \text{rate} = k\ce{[NO]^2[O2]}$$
  <details>
    <summary>Show solution</summary>
    <div class="solution">
      The reaction order is obtained from the exponents of the rate, not from the coefficients of the chemical equation.

      Since [NO]'s exponent is 2 and [O<sub>2</sub>]'s is 1, the reaction orders are thus <b>second order with respect to NO</b>, <b>first order with respect to O<sub>2</sub></b>, and the overall reaction order is <b>third order</b>.
    </div>
  </details>
</div>

<p>Reaction orders can also be determined from experiments.</p>

<div class="example">
  For the reaction \(\ce{A + 2B -> C + D}\), its rate law can be generally expressed as \(\text{rate} = k\ce{[A]}^m\ce{[B]}^n\). Given the following table of experiments, find the individual reaction orders with respect to A and B.

      <b><i>Finding order m with respect to A.</i></b> To find <i>m</i>, two experiments need to be compared. In this case, experiment 1 and 2 can be compared.

      $$\frac{\text{rate 1}}{\text{rate 2}} = \frac{k\ce{[A]^m_1[B]^n_1}}{k\ce{[A]^m_2[B]^n_2}} = \frac{\ce{[A]^m_1}}{\ce{[A]^m_2}} = \left(\frac{\ce{[A]_1}}{\ce{[A]_2}}\right)^m$$

      Substituting the actual values,

      $$\begin{align*}
      \frac{\pu{1.75 \times 10^{-3} mol/L*s}}{\pu{3.50 \times 10^{-3} mol/L*s}} &= \left(\frac{\pu{2.50 \times 10^{-2} mol/L}}{\pu{5.00 \times 10^{-2} mol/L}}\right)^m \\

      <b><i>Finding order n with respect to B.</i></b> Similarly, experiments 1 and 3 can be used.

      Substitute.

      $$\begin{align*}
      \frac{\pu{1.75 \times 10^{-3} mol/L*s}}{\pu{3.50 \times 10^{-3} mol/L*s}} &= \left(\frac{\pu{3.00 \times 10^{-2} mol/L}}{\pu{6.00 \times 10^{-2} mol/L}}\right)^n \\
      0.5 &= 0.5^n \\

      Since it is a first order reaction, the following formula is used.

      $$\ce{ln\frac{[C_4H_8]_0}{[C_4H_8]_t}}=kt$$

      Knowing that \(\pu{k = 87 s-1}\), \(\pu{t = 0.010 s}\), \(\ce{[C_4H_8]_0 = 2.00M}\), substitute.

      $$\begin{align*}
