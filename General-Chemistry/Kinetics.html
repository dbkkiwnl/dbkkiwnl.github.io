<p><b>Chemical kinetics</b> studies the rate at which a chemical process occurs.</p>

<h2>Factors Affecting Rate of Reaction</h2>
<p><b>Concentration.</b> A reaction can occur only if the reactant molecules collide. The more molecules present in the container, the more frequently they collide, and so the more often they react.</p>
<p class="center">Rate &prop; collision energy &prop; concentration</p>
<p><b>Surface area.</b> The greater its surface area, the more contact it makes with the other reactant, and the faster the reaction occurs. For example, in burning of a solid fuel like wood, increasing the surface area by chopping wood into smaller pieces makes it combust faster.</p>
<p><b>Temperature.</b></p>
<p><b>Energy of collisions.</b></p>

<h2>Reaction Rate</h2>
<p>The speed of a chemical reaction, or its <b>rate</b>, is defined as:</p>

$$\text{rate} = \frac{\Delta \text{concentration}}{\Delta \text{time}} \tag{1}$$

<p>In general, a reaction in the form \(\ce{aA + bB -> cC + dD}\), the rate can be expressed as:</p>

$$\text{rate} = -\frac{1}{a}\frac{\Delta [A]}{\Delta t} = -\frac{1}{b}\frac{\Delta [B]}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{c}\frac{\Delta [C]}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{d}\frac{\Delta [D]}{\Delta t} \tag{2}$$

<p>As the reactants decrease, the products increase. Observe that the signs for the reactants A and B are negative, while the products C and D are positive.</p>

<div class="example">
  Express the rate in terms of changes for the entire chemical equation.

  $$\ce{H2 (g) + I2 (g) -> 2HI (g)}$$
  <details>
    <summary>Show solution</summary>
    <div class="solution">
      The rate of the equation above is:

      $$\text{rate} = -\frac{\Delta \ce{[H2]}}{\Delta t} = -\frac{\Delta \ce{[I2]}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta \ce{[HI]}}{2 \Delta t}$$

<div class="example">
  Hydrogen gas has a nonpolluting combustion product (water vapor). It is used as a fuel aboard the space shuttle and in earthbound cars with prototype engines.

  $$\ce{2H2 (g) + O2 (g) -> 2H2O (g)}$$

  (a) Express the rate in terms of changes in [H<sub>2</sub>], [O<sub>2</sub>], [H<sub>2</sub>O] with time.
  <br>
  (b) When [O<sub>2</sub>] is decreasing at 0.23 mol/L⋅s, at what rate is [H<sub>2</sub>O] increasing?

  <details>
    <summary>Show solution</summary>
    <div class="solution">
      (a) Referring to Equation 2,

      $$\text{rate} = -\frac{\Delta \ce{[H2]}}{2 \Delta t} = -\frac{\Delta \ce{[O2]}}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\Delta \ce{[H2O]}}{\Delta t}$$

      (b) Since the rates of the chemical equation are all equal to each other, the rate of [O<sub>2</sub>] is half of the rate of [H<sub>2</sub>O]. Since [O<sub>2</sub>] is decreasing, it is negative: -0.23 mol/L⋅s.

      $$\begin{align*}
      \frac{1}{2} \frac{\Delta \ce{[H2O]}}{\Delta t} &= -\frac{\Delta \ce{[O2]}}{\Delta t} \\
      \frac{1}{2} \frac{\Delta \ce{[H2O]}}{\Delta t} &= -(\pu{-0.23 mol/L*s}) \\
      \frac{\Delta \ce{[H2O]}}{\Delta t} &= 2(\pu{0.23 mol/L*s}) \\
      \frac{\Delta \ce{[H2O]}}{\Delta t} &= \pu{0.46 mol/L*s} \\
      \end{align*}$$

      Therefore, [H<sub>2</sub>O] is increasing at a rate of <b>0.46 mol/L⋅s</b>.
