<h2>Reaction Rate</h2>
<p>The speed of a chemical reaction, or its <b>rate</b>, is defined as:</p>

$$\text{rate} = \frac{\Delta \text{concentration}}{\Delta \text{time}} \tag{1}$$

<p>For a reaction in the form \(\ce{A + B -> C}\), the rate can be expressed as:</p>

$$\text{rate} = -\frac{\Delta [A]}{\Delta t} = -\frac{\Delta [B]}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta [C]}{\Delta t} \tag{2}$$

<p>Observe that the signs for the reactants A and B are negative, while the product C is positive. For products and reactants with numerical coefficients other than 1, the reaction rate is expressed a little differently. For example,</p>

$$\ce{H2 (g) + I2 (g) -> 2HI (g)}$$

<p>The rate of the equation above is:</p>

$$\text{rate} = -\frac{\Delta \ce{[H2]}}{\Delta t} = -\frac{\Delta \ce{[I2]}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta \ce{[HI]}}{2 \Delta t}$$

<p>For HI's numerical coefficient 2, it is expressed in its reciprocal form 1/2. This is how numerical coefficients are written in reaction rate.</p>

<div class="example">
  Hydrogen gas has a nonpolluting combustion product (water vapor). It is used as a fuel aboard the space shuttle and in earthbound cars with prototype engines.

  $$\ce{2H2 (g) + O2 (g) -> 2H2O (g)}$$

  (a) Express the rate in terms of changes in [H<sub>2</sub>], [O<sub>2</sub>], [H<sub>2</sub>O] with time.

  (b) When [O<sub>2</sub>] is decreasing at 0.23 mol/L⋅s, at what rate is [H<sub>2</sub>O] increasing?

      (a) Referring to Equation 1,

      $$\text{rate} = -\frac{\Delta \ce{[H2]}}{2 \Delta t} = -\frac{\Delta \ce{[O2]}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta \ce{[H2O]}}{2 \Delta t}$$
