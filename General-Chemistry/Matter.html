<p>As a general starting point, <b>chemistry</b> is the study of matter and its properties, the changes that matter undergoes, and the energy associated with those changes.</p>

<p><b>Matter</b> is anything that occupies space and has mass. It is composed of tiny particles called <i>atoms</i>.</p>

<h2>States of Matter</h2>
<p>Each state of matter is defined by how the sample fills a container.</p>
<ul>
	<li>A <b>solid</b> has a fixed shape that does not conform to its container. It is <i>not</i> defined by rigidity and hardness.</li>
	<li>A <b>liquid</b> has a varying shape that does conform to its container, only to the extent of its volume; liquids have an <i>upper surface</i>.</li>
	<li>A <b>gas</b> also has a varying shapethat conforms to its container, filling the entire container; having no surface.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Properties of Matter</h2>
<p><b>Physical properties</b> are characteristics a substance shows by itself, without changing into or interacting with another substance. It can be either <i>intensive</i> or <i>extensive</i>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Intensive properties</b> are independent of the amount of matter present (pressure, temperature).</li>
  <li><b>Extensive properties</b> are dependent on the amount of matter present (mass, volume).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Chemical properties</b> are characteristics a substance shows as it changes into or interacts with another substance. As an example, observe Table 1.</p>

    <td>Slowly forms deep-blue solution in aqueous ammonia</td>

<h2>Classification of Matter</h2>
<p>Matter is classified into either a <b>pure substance</b> or a <b>mixture</b>.</p>

<p>A <b>pure substance</b> can be an element or compound. While an <i>element</i> cannot be separated into simpler substances by chemical methods (eg. \(\ce{O}\)), a <i>compound</i> is composed of two or more elements in fixed proportions and can be separated by chemical methods (eg. \(\ce{CO2}\)).</p>

<p><b>Mixtures</b> consist of two or more pure substances that retain their individual identities and can be separated by physical methods. <i>Homogeneous mixtures</i> have a uniform composition and properties, while <i>heteregeneous mixtures</i> are not uniform.</p>

<h2>Methods of Separating Mixtures</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Evaporation</b> is a method used to separate a mixture of a liquid with a dissolved solid, evaporating a liquid and leaving behind a solid.</li>
  <li><b>Distillation</b> is a separation technique used to separate components of a liquid mixture by a process of heating and cooling.</li>
  <li><b>Filtration</b> is a technique used to separate the components of a mixture containing an undissolved solid in a liquid by using a funnel with filter paper to retain the solids while letting the liquid through.</li>
  <li><b>Chromatography</b> is a separation method based on how different components in a mixture have different affinities for stationary and mobile phases.</li>
</ul>
