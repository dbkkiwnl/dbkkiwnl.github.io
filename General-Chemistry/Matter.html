<h1 class="lesson-title">Matter and Its Properties</h1>

<p>As a general starting point, <b>chemistry</b> is the study of matter and its properties, the changes that matter undergoes, and the energy associated with those changes.</p>

<p><b>Matter</b> is anything that occupies space and has mass. It is composed of tiny particles called <i>atoms</i>.</p>

<h2>States of Matter</h2>
<p>Each state of matter is defined by how the sample fills a container.</p>
<ul>
	<li>A <b>solid</b> has a fixed shape that does not conform to its container. It is <i>not</i> defined by rigidity and hardness.</li>
	<li>A <b>liquid</b> has a varying shape that does conform to its container, only to the extent of its volume; liquids have an <i>upper surface</i>.</li>
	<li>A <b>gas</b> also has a varying that conforms to its container, filling the entire container.</li>
</ul>
