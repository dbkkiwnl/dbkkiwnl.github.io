<h1>Intermolecular Forces</h1>

<p>There are four types of <b>intermolecular forces</b>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>hydrogen bonding</li>
  <li>dispersion forces</li>
  <li>dipole-dipole attractions</li>
  <li>ion-dipole attractions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hydrogen Bonding</h2>
<p>A <b>hydrogen bond</b> is a special type of intermolecular attraction between hydrogen and other more electronegative atoms (fluorine, oxygen, nitrogen). It is the strongest intermolecular force out of the four.</p>

<p>Some examples include hydrogen fluoride (HF), ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), and hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S).</p>

<h2>Dispersion Forces</h2>
<p><b>Dispersion forces</b> (also known as <b>London dispersion forces</b>) are temporarily created when two adjacent atoms form dipoles. It is present in all molecules, and is the weakest type of intermolecular force.</p>

<p>London dispersion forces are the only forces in nonpolar molecules such as CH<sub>4</sub> and Br<sub>2</sub>.</p>
