<h1 class="lesson-title">Central Limit Theorem</h1>

<p>The <b>Central Limit Theorem</b> states that the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution, as the sample size increases.</p>

<div class="example">
  A sample of 60 students' ages was obtained to estimate the mean of all the students. xÌ„ = 15.3 years and the population variance is 16.
