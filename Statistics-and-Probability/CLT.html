title: Central Limit Theorem

<h1 class="lesson-title">Central Limit Theorem</h1>

<p>The <b>Central Limit Theorem</b> states that the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution, as the sample size increases. This means that regardless of the initial population distribution, the sampling distribution will approach the normal distribution as <i>n</i> gets larger.</p>

<p>The standard error of the mean or the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sampling mean, denoted as &sigma;<sub>x̄</sub> is calculated by:</p>

$$\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \tag{1}$$

<p>where &sigma; is the population standard deviation and <i>n</i> is the sample size.</p>

<div class="example">
  Assume that the variable is normally distributed, the average time it takes a group of senior high school students to complete a certain examination is 46.2 minutes while the standard deviation is 8 minutes. What is the probability that a randomly selected senior high school student will complete the examination in less than 43 minutes? Does it seem reasonable that a senior high school student would finish the examination in less than 43 minutes?

    <div class="solution">
      The following are given: &mu; = 46.2 minutes; &sigma; = 8 minutes; X̅ = 43 minutes, and <i>P</i>(<i>X̅</i> < 43) is missing.

      In order to find the correlating z-score:
      $$\begin{align*}
      z &= \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma} \\
        &= \frac{43 - 46.2}{8} \\
      z &= 0.40 
      \end{align*}$$

      Using the <a href="/Statistics-and-Probability/Z-Table">z-table</a>, the corresponding value when <i>z</i> = 0.40 is 0.1554.
