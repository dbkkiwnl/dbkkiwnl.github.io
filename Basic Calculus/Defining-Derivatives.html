title: The Definition of a Derivative
---
<h1>The Definition of a Derivative</h1>
<div class="definition">
  The derivative of a function \(f(x)\) is defined as: $$ f'(x) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x} \tag{1} $$
</div>

<p>
  Note that there are (<i>confusingly</i>) multiple notations for derivatives. However, each one has their own benefit. In <b>Lagrange notation</b>, a prime mark (\('\)) denotes a derivative. For a function \(f\), its first derivative at \(x\) is written as \(f'(x)\).
