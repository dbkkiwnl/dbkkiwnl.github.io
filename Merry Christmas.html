        <h1>Merry Christmas!</h1>
        
        <p>It's the 25th of December, 2022. It's 139 days since we met each other for the first time in that classroom all those months ago. I think now's the perfect time to tell you, that I really appreciate you, and the times we've spent together. I know I've said this before. Maybe many times even.</p>
        
        <p>Back then, I felt really out of place. The only people I knew were Naoki and Reynan. Though we didn't interact much on the first day, our interactions in August is probably one of the most important things we had. I feel a little lucky, with the chance that Sir Allan gave me to pick my partner, and the whole Buwan ng Wika event. It was there, in each practice we had, I could look into your eyes, even just for a little bit. It was then that I knew that I had a crush on you.</p>
        
        <p>The following months was me attempting to keep talking to you. Even after the Carinosa had ended. Each single time you told me something about yourself, I would attempt to remember it or even put it in my notes. I remember that one time where I forgot what your dream job was. It was being an animator, right? I try to cherish every moment we had together.</p>
        
        <p>Of course, November 28 is quite an important day, for both of us. It was when you would make me the happiest I've felt. I'm still not sure how to exactly describe what I felt when you asked me that question. If I could, I would've shouted in excitement. It's now Christmas. I guess I'll end this with the things I want to say the most.</p>
        
        <p>Merry Christmas, Kristy. Let's stay together for a long time, my loves. I love you.</p>
