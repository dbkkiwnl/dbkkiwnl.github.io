        In Figure 1, the graph shows that her presence is directly proportional to the amount of happiness in a given day. It is noted that this effect was first observed during the senior high school Quiz Bee held on September, wherein the researcher felt embarrassment or shyness after seeing Valerie. Furthermore, this phenomena is also observed when she is absent from class.

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><em>Figure 2.</em> Rate of shyness after time elapsed</p>

    </div>

    <p>In the initial months of this school year, the researcher observed that feelings of shyness were present when talking to Valerie in person. Despite this, the researcher was still able to hold conversations through messages without any major problems. It is noted that the researcher, on some occassions, cringed at what he said through text.</p>

    <p>This effect has lessened in the following months. Whether it is due to the increase in the researcher's confidence or through other reasons is unknown. However, it can be said that the researcher heard the phrase "take the risk" maybe one too many times.</p>

    <p>Nervousness is defined by three descriptions: <em>none</em>, <em>some</em>,  and <em>extreme</em>. In the making of this study, the researcher felt various degrees of nervousness and second thoughts. Initially, he thought that this may be cringe or <em>jejemon</em>. However, the researcher decided to show this to her anyway.</p>

    <p>Liking is by the same three descriptions. It may be said that the researcher had the feeling of <em>like at first sight</em>. The researcher once attempted to try and ignore these feelings for her, which ultimately resulted in failure. It turns out that what the heart feels is not easily suppressed. Furthermore, because of this, the feelings only came back stronger.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The data shown previously leads the researcher to conclude that he has <b>definite</b> feelings for Valerie.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>This research has been a rare opportunity to make. This would not have been possible without the support of Mica Padilla and Jean Binal, who helped the researcher to do this and not overthink it.</p>
    
    <p>The researcher would also like to acknowledge Valerie Entera, for not just being the main inspiration of this study, but for the moments that have and will continue to pass.</p>
