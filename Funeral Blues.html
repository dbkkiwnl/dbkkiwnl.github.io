    <h1>Funeral Blues (Stop All the Clocks)</h1>
    <p>
    	Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,<br />
	Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,<br />
	Silence the pianos and with muffled drum<br />
	Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.<br />
	Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead<br />
	Scribbling on the sky the message He Is Dead,<br />
	Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,<br />
	Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.<br />
	He was my North, my South, my East and West,<br />
	My working week and my Sunday rest,<br />
	My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;<br />
	I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong.<br />
	The stars are not wanted now: put out every one;<br />
	Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;<br />
	Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood;<br />
	For nothing now can ever come to any good.<br />
    </p>
