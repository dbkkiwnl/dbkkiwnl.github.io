<p>In the previous chapter, the process of differentiation was defined. The inverse of addition is subtraction, and the inverse of multiplication is division. In this chapter, the inverse operation of differentiation will be explored.</p>
<p>Think of it as this: given a function <i>f</i>, is there a function <i>F</i> whose derivative is <i>f</i>?</p>

<div class="example">
  Observe the function \(f(x) = 6x^2 + 2x\). Its antiderivative is \(F(x) = 2x^3 + x^2\). We can check by seeing that \(F'(x) = 6x^2 + 2x\), which is equal to the original function \(f(x)\). In fact, we can have any constant after 6x<sup>2</sup> + 2x, which still would be an antiderivative.

  \(6x^2 + 2x + 1,\ 6x^2 + 2x +2,\ 6x^2 + 2x -1,\ 6x^2 + 2x - 2\dots ) are all antiderivatives. Thus, any function of the form \(F'(x) = 6x^2 + 2x + C\) where \(C\in\mathbb{R}\) is an antiderivative.
</div>

<div class="definition">
  A function <i>F</i> is an antiderivative of the function <i>f</i> on an interval <i>I</i> if <i>F'</i>(<i>x</i>) = <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) for every value of <i>x</i> in <i>I</i>.
