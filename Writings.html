    <h2>one - 6/22</h2>
    <p>"Hey, can we meet up? I need to tell you something." He texted her. Six months had passed by since they *ended*, as she put it. The letters flashed on her screen as the memories slowly came back and flodded her memories. All those times, from the blind date set up by their classmates, until the fight that caused them to break suddenly rushed back in.</p>

    <p>She had contemplated even responding to the text message, and while her mind said no, her heart said yes. All of a sudden, her feet dragged her across to in front of him once again. She sat alone on the chair, gazing out into the window. What seemed to the beginning of a storm came over the city, and rain started to fall ever so slightly. The flurry of people outside rushed to find cover, and a man in a dashing black jacket came inside the cafe. It was him.</p>
        
    <p>He briefly went to buy a coffee before finding her sitting down near the front windows. She was staring into the raindrops falling onto the stone brick pavement, but he could've sworn she was looking at him. With each step he took closer to her, she attempted to look unfazed, as if nothing had happened. </p>
        
    <p>"Thanks for coming." He quietly said, before taking a seat on the wooden chair in front of her. The chair creaked loudly, and it was just the two of them alone in the store, the pitter-patter ofs the rain filling in the background noise.</p>
        
    <p>"What did you want to say?" She says, trying to put on a stoic face.</p>
        
    <p>"I know we ended on... not so good terms." He gripped the coffee cup. For a moment in time, the silence crept in and they could only look at each other. Neither one really knew what the other felt, was it longing? Fear? Anger? Pain? All she knew was she wanted him back.</p>
        
    <p>"That's one way to put it."</p>
        
    <p>"I'm sorry. I never got a chance to tell you that. I know I hurt you badly, and I-" She cut him off, leaning forward and caressing his visibly shaking hand on his coffee cup. Taking a deep breath, she said "Don't say that." He looked confused, not expecting her to hold his hand. "It was as much as my fault as it was yours. We were only kids back then."</p>
        
    <p>"But I ghosted you. People don't just do that without reason, especially to you then." He could only look down, being ashamed to even look her in the eye. "I'm sorry."</p>
        
    <p>"I forgive you." She said. He looks at her again, shocked that he suddenly blurted out those words. "Just suddenly?"</p>
        
    <p>"I've forgiven you for a long time." They stare into each other's eyes once again, both not knowing what to say next. He had only expected her to be still mad at him, but this only made him feel worse. Before he could open his mouth to speak, she broke the silence. "I've been waiting for you to come back." Her hand clasps his, just how it was years before, when they first held each other's hands blindfolded.</p> 
        
    <p>"Won't it be difficult?"</p>
        
    <p>"It will, but I know we'll work things out. I spent sleepless nights waiting for you, listening to Taylor Swift songs and doing God knows what, so I can't waste this opportunity... our opportunity."</p>
